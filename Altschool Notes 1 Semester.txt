How the internet works.

The web involves two things the client and the server

Document Object Model(DOM) is basically all the contents on a webpage and this includes paragraphs, videos, texts, images e.t.c.

An IP address is how a computer is located on the internet. A DNS (Domain Naming service) is a ledger system that contains all domains(www.togo.net, teni.com) which are mapped to an IP address. Anyone connected to the internet is given a unique IP address.

The internet has a protocol for communication btw the client and server and this role is played by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP(S)Secure).

Slide 7: Three Core Web Technologies.

HTML: Structure
	Defines the content and organization (Skeleton)
	The "Noun" of a webpage

CSS: Presentation
	Controls appearance (Flesh)
	The "Adjectives" of a webpage

JavaScript: Behavior
	Adds interactivity and functionality (Functions)
	The "Verb" of a webpage

Attributes are defined in the opening tags of an html element

Learning HTML
The purpose of HTML is to apply meaning to texts on a webpage and not presentation

Tags
Tags surround content and applies meaning to it.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
	This is my first web page
</body>
</html>


<!DOCTYPE html>, is a document type declaration and it lets the browser know which flavor of HTML you’re using (HTML5, in this case).
<html> is the opening tag that kicks things off and tells the browser that everything between that and the </html> closing tag is an HTML document. 
The content between <body> and </body> is the main content of the document that will appear in the browser window.

Attributes
Attributes are extra bits of information. 
Attributes appear inside the opening tag and their values sit inside quotation marks. 
They look something like <tag attribute="value">Margarine</tag>.

Page Titles
This includes a <head></head> and a <title></title> tag

Paragraphs
<p></p>

Headings
<h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6/>. Headers should be used in the order it is listed

Lists
There are three types of list; unordered lists, ordered lists and definition lists.

Unordered lists are used for non-sequential lists in order words bulleted lists. As it implies not in order. <ul></ul>

Ordered lists are used for numbers, which implies it's in order. <ol></ol>

Links

An anchor tag (a) is used to define a link, but you also need to add something to the anchor tag — the destination of the link. It allows us to navigate inside a website
