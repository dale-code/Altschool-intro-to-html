How the internet works.

The web involves two things the client and the server

Document Object Model(DOM) is basically all the contents on a webpage and this includes paragraphs, videos, texts, images e.t.c.

An IP address is how a computer is located on the internet. A DNS (Domain Naming service) is a ledger system that contains all domains(www.togo.net, teni.com) which are mapped to an IP address. Anyone connected to the internet is given a unique IP address.

The internet has a protocol for communication btw the client and server and this role is played by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP(S)Secure).
